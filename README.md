# Arduino Speaker Selector

This is a very basic speaker selector that could be used anywhere, instead of purchasing an expensive electronic speaker selector this could be used. It could be built in under 10 minutes, and costs about 45$. 

# Part List:
**Arduino:**  Arduino Mega2560
**Relay:** Any 5V relay. In this case I got a 8 channel relay.
**Ethernet Sheild:** Any ethernet shield

# Extras
I bought a plastic box to put the relay and Arduino in, because it would be messy without it. I also added a fan to cool the components down.
